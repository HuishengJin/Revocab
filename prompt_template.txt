Modify a Chrome extension called Revocab that helps the user in learning English by replacing synonyms of a list of vocabs that the user is trying to learn with the vocabs.

{PLACEHOLDER}

Before modifying anything, here are some reminders:
1. You are not to create a template or a beginning guide! Get all the work done in one go! No empty files or placeholders in functions!
2. Replacement should be done with context consideration so that replacement makes sense just as the original by utilizing the mask-filling ability of ALBERT.
3. You're encouraged to write some of the methods and functions in the utils folder. Especially those that may be called multiple times.
4. Notice that webpack automatically loads a js file for a html file. So, do not add a script node for html file under 'src', because doing so would duplicate the script.
5. The roles of functions could be easily guessed just by seeing their names. The arguments, variable names, function names, and file names must not be confusing or ambiguous.
6. NEVER write any method, logic, function, or algorithm twice.
7. Ensure that EVERY function is placed in the BEST position that MAKES THE MOST SENSE.
8. WHENEVER something is modified, ALWAYS consider its effects. For example, altering the util name would necessitate modifying all the codes that called it.

Say 'I am prepared' and I will tell you what to modify.
